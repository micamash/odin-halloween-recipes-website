    <h2>Description:</h2>

    <p>Dates are stuffed with cream cheese, wrapped in bacon and baked until crisp. These are delicious and very easy to make for a party. You can serve them at room temperature, so it is okay to make a few hours in advance!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>toothpicks (soaked in water for at least 30 minutes)</li>
        <li>1 pound sliced bacon, cut in half</li>
        <li>1 pound pitted dates, sliced halfway lengthwise</li>
        <li>4 oz cream cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C)</li>
        <li>Spread cream cheese into the center of the dates. Close the halves of the dates, and wrap a half-slice of bacon around the outside. Secure each one with a toothpick. Arrange in a baking dish or on a baking sheet with sides to catch any grease.</li>
        <li>Bake for 30-40 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the bacon is crisp. Turn dates over after the first 20 minutes for even cooking.</li>
    </ol>
